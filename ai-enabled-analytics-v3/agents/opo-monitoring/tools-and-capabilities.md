# OPO Monitoring Tools and Capabilities

Capabilities describe the contract between the OPO Monitoring Agent and the
shared Application Agent Runtime.

The Capability Adaptor is owned by the Application Agent Runtime. The
Capability Adaptor translates logical agent capability requests into Analytics
Foundation API requests.

## Capability summary

| Operation | Capability | Side effect | Approval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Read OPO KPI trends | `data_query.read_trends` | No | No |
| Create investigation workspace | `workspace.create` | Yes | No |
| Apply workspace filters | `workspace.add_filters` | Yes | No |
| Register wafer data | `workspace.register_dataset` | Yes | Yes |
| Read wafer evidence | `data_query.read_wafers` | No | No |

## Runtime invocation rules

For each invocation, the runtime must:

1. Confirm that the capability is declared by the agent.
2. Resolve the capability from the Capability Registry.
3. Map workflow state into the declared request.
4. Validate the mapped request.
5. Verify required permissions.
6. Verify approval when required.
7. Record the capability invocation.
8. Invoke the configured Analytics Foundation client.
9. Record success or failure.
10. Map the declared result into workflow state.

## Boundary rules

The agent must not directly access:

- PostgreSQL
- StarRocks
- HDFS
- object storage
- Analytics Foundation service databases
- Analytics Foundation internal implementation classes

The OPO Monitoring Service may call Analytics Foundation APIs directly for
existing deterministic application functions.

Only Analytics Foundation operations originating from an agent workflow use
the runtime-owned Capability Adaptor.
