# OPO Monitoring Investigation Workflow

The workflow contains four logical stages.

## 1. Interpret the request

The model extracts trend filters and the requested outlier criteria into typed
contracts.

## 2. Read and analyse trends

The runtime invokes the trend-query capability and then runs deterministic
application logic to identify candidate outliers.

The language model does not decide which trend rows satisfy the deterministic
outlier rule.

## 3. Request analyst approval

If candidate outliers exist, the runtime pauses and asks the analyst whether
the selected candidate should be investigated.

A rejected decision ends the investigation without creating a workspace.

## 4. Perform the deep investigation

After approval, the runtime:

1. Creates an investigation workspace.
2. Applies the selected filters.
3. Registers the required wafer-level data.
4. Reads wafer-level evidence.
5. Produces an evidence-based findings summary.

## Observability

Every operation is represented explicitly so the runtime can expose:

- current activity
- model activity
- capability activity
- approval requests
- capability results
- errors
- completion status

## Runtime compatibility note

The v3 execution engine must recognize these node types:

- `model`
- `operation`
- `capability`
- `approval`

The `operation` node type represents deterministic application logic that does
not call the model and does not call Analytics Foundation.
