# OPO Monitoring Interaction Sequences

## Existing deterministic application path

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Analyst
    participant FE as OPO Monitoring FE
    participant Service as OPO Monitoring Service
    participant AF as Analytics Foundation APIs

    Analyst->>FE: Open trends or workspace function
    FE->>Service: Application request
    Service->>AF: Direct deterministic API request
    AF-->>Service: Platform response
    Service-->>FE: Application response
    FE-->>Analyst: Display result
```

The deterministic path does not use the Application Agent Runtime or the
Capability Adaptor.

## Rejected approval path

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Analyst
    participant CopilotFE as Analytics Copilot FE
    participant CopilotService as Analytics Copilot Service
    participant Runtime as Application Agent Runtime

    Runtime-->>CopilotService: Investigation approval request
    CopilotService-->>CopilotFE: Approval action
    CopilotFE-->>Analyst: Display approval request

    Analyst->>CopilotFE: Reject investigation
    CopilotFE->>CopilotService: Submit rejection
    CopilotService->>Runtime: Resume with rejected decision

    Runtime-->>CopilotService: Investigation cancelled
    CopilotService-->>CopilotFE: Cancellation response
    CopilotFE-->>Analyst: Display cancellation
```

No workspace or data registration operation is executed after rejection.
