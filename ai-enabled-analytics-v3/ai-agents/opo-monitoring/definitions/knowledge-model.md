# OPO Monitoring Knowledge Model

## Application-owned knowledge

The OPO Monitoring application owns:

- KPI definitions
- trend semantics
- outlier meaning
- relevant filters
- relevant analytical data
- investigation logic
- evidence interpretation

## Analytics Foundation-owned knowledge

Analytics Foundation owns:

- workspace identity and status
- registration state
- governed service contracts
- asset metadata
- processing state

## Runtime-owned knowledge

The Application Agent Runtime owns:

- conversation identifiers
- LangGraph checkpoint identifiers
- node execution status
- pending approval actions
- capability registration
- capability request mapping
- capability result mapping
- runtime telemetry

Runtime information is operational context and must not be presented as domain
evidence.

## Evidence interpretation

A finding may describe:

- an observed trend
- a threshold violation
- a comparison between supplied observations
- a grouping pattern present in supplied evidence
- a spatial pattern present in supplied wafer evidence
- a limitation of the available evidence

A finding must not describe:

- an unobserved measurement
- an undeclared KPI
- an unavailable time range
- an invented dataset
- an unsupported root cause
- an invented relationship between process variables

A plausible explanation remains an alternative explanation until additional
evidence confirms the explanation.

## Confidence interpretation

`low` confidence means that the available evidence is limited or supports
multiple explanations.

`medium` confidence means that a consistent pattern is present, but causality
has not been established.

`high` confidence may only be used when the supplied evidence directly and
consistently supports the finding. High confidence does not automatically mean
that a root cause has been confirmed.
